"Edward by the grace of God King of England, lord of Ireland and duke of Aquitaine sends greetings\n"
"to all to whom the present letters come. We have inspected the great charter of the lord Henry, late\n"
"King of England, our father, concerning the liberties of England in these words:\n"
"\n"
"Henry by the grace of God King of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine and\n"
"count of Anjou sends greetings to his archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons, sheriffs,\n"
"reeves, ministers and all his bailiffs and faithful men inspecting the present charter. Know that we, at\n"
"the prompting of God and for the health of our soul and the souls of our ancestors and successors, for\n"
"the glory of holy Church and the improvement of our realm, freely and out of our good will have\n"
"given and granted to the archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons and all of our realm these\n"
"liberties written below to hold in our realm of England in perpetuity.\n"
"\n"
"(1) In the first place we grant to God and confirm by this our present charter for ourselves and our\n"
"heirs in perpetuity that the English Church is to be free and to have all its rights fully and its liberties\n"
"entirely. We furthermore grant and give to all the freemen of our realm for ourselves and our heirs in\n"
"perpetuity the liberties written below to have and to hold to them and their heirs from us and our\n"
"heirs in perpetuity.\n"
"\n"
"(2) If any of our earls or barons, or anyone else holding from us in chief by military service should\n"
"die, and should his heir be of full age and owe relief, the heir is to have his inheritance for the ancient\n"
"relief, namely the heir or heirs of an earl for a whole county £100, the heir or heirs of a baron for a\n"
"whole barony 100 marks, the heir or heirs of a knight for a whole knight’s fee 100 shillings at most,\n"
"and he who owes less will give less, according to the ancient custom of (knights’) fees.\n"
"\n"
"(3) If, however, the heir of such a person is under age, his lord is not to have custody of him and his\n"
"land until he has taken homage from the heir, and after such an heir has been in custody, when he\n"
"comes of age, namely at twenty-one years old, he is to have his inheritance without relief and without\n"
"fine, saving that if, whilst under age, he is made a knight, his land will nonetheless remain in the\n"
"custody of his lords until the aforesaid term.\n"
"\n"
"(4) The keeper of the land of such an heir who is under age is only to take reasonable receipts from\n"
"the heir’s land and reasonable customs and reasonable services, and this without destruction or waste\n"
"of men or things. And if we assign custody of any such land to a sheriff or to anyone else who\n"
"should answer to us for the issues, and such a person should commit destruction or waste, we will\n"
"take recompense from him and the land will be assigned to two law-worthy and discreet men of that\n"
"fee who will answer to us or to the person to whom we assign such land for the land’s issues. And if\n"
"we give or sell to anyone custody of any such land and that person commits destruction or waste, he\n"
"is to lose custody and the land is to be assigned to two law-worthy and discreet men of that fee who\n"
"similarly will answer to us as is aforesaid.\n"
"\n"
"(5) The keeper, for as long as he has the custody of the land of such (an heir), is to maintain the\n"
"houses, parks, fishponds, ponds, mills and other things pertaining to that land from the issues of the\n"
"same land, and he will restore to the heir, when the heir comes to full age, all his land stocked with\n"
"ploughs and all other things in at least the same condition as when he received it. All these things are\n"
"to be observed in the custodies of archbishoprics, bishoprics, abbeys, priories, churches and vacant\n"
"offices which pertain to us, save that such custodies ought not to be sold.\n"
"\n"
"(6) Heirs are to be married without disparagement.\n"
"\n"
"(7) A widow, after the death of her husband, is immediately and without any difficulty to have her\n"
"marriage portion and her inheritance, nor is she to pay anything for her dower or her marriage portion\n"
"or for her inheritance which her husband and she held on the day of her husband’s death, and she\n"
"shall remain in the chief dwelling place of her husband for forty days after her husband’s death,\n"
"within which time dower will be assigned her if it has not already been assigned, unless that house is\n"
"a castle, and if it is a castle which she leaves, then a suitable house will immediately be provided for\n"
"her in which she may properly dwell until her dower is assigned to her in accordance with what is\n"
"aforesaid, and in the meantime she is to have her reasonable necessities (estoverium) from the\n"
"common property. As dower she will be assigned the third part of all the lands of her husband which\n"
"were his during his lifetime, save when she was dowered with less at the church door. No widow\n"
"shall be distrained to marry for so long as she wishes to live without a husband, provided that she\n"
"gives surety that she will not marry without our assent if she holds of us, or without the assent of her\n"
"lord, if she holds of another.\n"
"\n"
"(8) Neither we nor our bailiffs will seize any land or rent for any debt, as long as the existing chattels\n"
"of the debtor suffice for the payment of the debt and as long as the debtor is ready to pay the debt,\n"
"nor will the debtor’s guarantors be distrained for so long as the principal debtor is able to pay the\n"
"debt; and should the principal debtor default in his payment of the debt, not having the means to\n"
"repay it, or should he refuse to pay it despite being able to do so, the guarantors will answer for the\n"
"debt and, if they wish, they are to have the lands and rents of the debtor until they are repaid the debt\n"
"that previously they paid on behalf of the debtor, unless the principal debtor can show that he is quit\n"
"in respect to these guarantors.\n"
"\n"
"(9) The city of London is to have all its ancient liberties and customs. Moreover we wish and grant\n"
"that all other cities and boroughs and vills and the barons of the Cinque Ports and all ports are to have\n"
"all their liberties and free customs.\n"
"\n"
"(10) No-one is to be distrained to do more service for a knight’s fee or for any other free tenement\n"

"justiciar, will send our justices once a year to each county, so that, together with the knights of the\n"
"counties, that may take the aforesaid assizes in the counties; and those assizes which cannot be\n"
"completed in that visitation of the county by our aforesaid justices assigned to take the said assizes\n"
"are to be completed elsewhere by the justices in their visitation; and those which cannot be\n"
"completed by them on account of the difficulty of various articles (of law) are to be referred to our\n"
"justices of the Bench and completed there.\n"

"offence, and for a major offence according to its magnitude, saving his sufficiency (salvo\n"
"contenemento suo), and a merchant likewise, saving his merchandise, and any villain other than one\n"
"of our own is to be amerced in the same way, saving his necessity (salvo waynagio) should he fall\n"
"into our mercy, and none of the aforesaid amercements is to be imposed save by the oath of honest\n"
"and law-worthy men of the neighbourhood. Earls and barons are not to be amerced save by their\n"
"peers and only in accordance with the manner of their offence.\n"

"attach and enroll all the goods and chattels of the dead man found in lay fee, to the value of the said\n"
"debt, by view of law-worthy men, so that nothing is to be removed thence until the debt that remains\n"
"is paid to us, and the remainder is to be released to the executors to discharge the will of the dead\n"
"man, and if nothing is owed to us from such a person, all the chattels are to pass to the (use of) the\n"
"dead man, saving to the dead man’s wife and children their reasonable portion.\n"
"\n"
"(19) No constable or his bailiff is to take corn or other chattels from anyone who not themselves of a\n"
"vill where a castle is built, unless the constable or his bailiff immediately offers money in payment of\n"
"obtains a respite by the wish of the seller. If the person whose corn or chattels are taken is of such a\n"
"vill, then the constable or his bailiff is to pay the purchase price within forty days.\n"
"\n"
"(20) No constable is to distrain any knight to give money for castle guard if the knight is willing to\n"
"do such guard in person or by proxy of any other honest man, should the knight be prevented from\n"
"doing so by just cause. And if we take or send such a knight into the army, he is to be quit of (castle)\n"
"guard in accordance with the length of time the we have him in the army for the fee for which he has\n"
"done service in the army.\n"

"\n"
"(27) If any persons hold from us at fee farm or in socage or burgage, and hold land from another by\n"
"knight service, we are not, by virtue of such a fee farm or socage or burgage, to have custody of the\n"
"heir or their land which pertains to another’s fee, nor are we to have custody of such a fee farm or\n"
"socage or burgage unless this fee farm owes knight service. We are not to have the custody of an\n"
"heir or of any land which is held from another by knight service on the pretext of some small\n"
"serjeanty held from us by service of rendering us knives or arrows or suchlike things.\n"

"spoken word, without reliable witnesses being produced for the same.\n"

"free customs, or outlawed or exiled or in any way ruined, nor will we go against such a man or send\n"

"secure conduct in leaving and coming to England and in staying and going through England both by\n"
"land and by water to buy and to sell, without any evil exactions, according to the ancient and right\n"
"customs, save in time of war, and if they should be from a land at war against us and be found in our\n"
"land at the beginning of the war, they are to be attached without damage to their bodies or goods until\n"
"it is established by us or our chief justiciar in what way the merchants of our land are treated who at\n"
"such a time are found in the land that is at war with us, and if our merchants are safe there, the other\n"
"merchants are to be safe in our land.\n"
"\n"
"(31) If anyone dies holding of any escheat such as the honour of Wallingford, Boulogne,\n"
"Nottingham, Lancaster or of other escheats which are in our hands and which are baronies, his heir is\n"
"not to give any other relief or render any other service to us that would not have been rendered to the\n"
"baron if the barony were still held by a baron, and we shall hold such things in the same way as the\n"
"baron held them, nor, on account of such a barony or escheat, are we to have the escheat or custody\n"
"of any of our men unless the man who held the barony or the escheat held elsewhere from us in chief.\n"
"\n"

"his land is sufficient to render due service to the lord of the fee as pertains to that fee.\n"
"\n"
"(33) All patrons of abbeys which have charters of the kings of England over advowson or ancient\n"

"death of that woman’s husband.\n"
"\n"
"(35) No county court is to be held save from month to month, and where the greater term used to be\n"
"held, so will it be in future, nor will any sheriff or his bailiff make his tourn through the hundred save\n"
"for twice a year and only in the place that is due and customary, namely once after Easter and again\n"
"after Michaelmas, and the view of frankpledge is to be taken at the Michaelmas term without\n"
"exception, in such a way that every man is to have his liberties which he had or used to have in the\n"
"time of King H(enry II) my grandfather or which he has acquired since. The view of frankpledge is\n"
"to be taken so that our peace be held and so that the tithing is to be held entire as it used to be, and so\n"
"that the sheriff does not seek exceptions but remains content with that which the sheriff used to have\n"
"in taking the view in the time of King H(enry) our grandfather.\n"
"\n"
"(36) Nor is it permitted to anyone to give his land to a religious house in such a way that he receives\n"
"it back from such a house to hold, nor is it permitted to any religious house to accept the land of\n"
"anyone in such way that the land is restored to the person from whom it was received to hold. If\n"
"anyone henceforth gives his land in such a way to any religious house and is convicted of the same,\n"
"the gift is to be entirely quashed and such land is to revert to the lord of that fee.\n"
"\n"
"(37) Scutage furthermore is to be taken as it used to be in the time of King H(enry) our grandfather,\n"
"and all liberties and free customs shall be preserved to archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors,\n"
"Templars, Hospitallers, earls, barons and all others, both ecclesiastical and secular persons, just as\n"
"they formerly had.\n"
"\n"
"All these aforesaid customs and liberties which we have granted to be held in our realm in so far as\n"
"pertains to us are to be observed by all of our realm, both clergy and laity, in so far as pertains to\n"
"them in respect to their own men. For this gift and grant of these liberties and of others contained in\n"
"our charter over the liberties of the forest, the archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, earls, barons,\n"
"knights, fee holders and all of our realm have given us a fifteenth part of all their movable goods.\n"
"Moreover we grant to them for us and our heirs that neither we nor our heirs will seek anything by\n"
"which the liberties contained in this charter might be infringed or damaged, and should anything be\n"
"obtained from anyone against this it is to count for nothing and to be held as nothing. With these\n"
