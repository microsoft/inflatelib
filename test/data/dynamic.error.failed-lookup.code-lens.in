
# Produces a single block whose code length alphabet's code lengths are chosen such that the tree has leaves with no
# assigned symbols. The length/distance code lengths portion of the input then uses one of these invalid inputs causing
# a failure
# NOTE: This test is valid for both Deflate and Deflate64

# Unlike the literal/length and distance trees, the max code size is 7 bits, which fits entirely inside the lookup table
# of our Huffman tree implementation. The tree looks like:
#     start
#   /       \
#  /\       /
# 0  17    / \
#        18  /
#           /
