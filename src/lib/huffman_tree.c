/*
 * The size of the each lookup table, N, is decided as follows: 7 bits for the code length and distance tree, and 9 bits
 * for the literal/length tree. To calculate the size needed for the binary tree portion of the array, we need to
 * calculate the maximum number of nodes that can be in all of the subtrees combined. Thanks to the way that the Huffman
 * codes are specified, all but the "right side" of the corresponding Huffman tree is optimally "packed." That is, all
 * nodes have either zero or two children. This means that, with the exception of the right-most path, we can relate the
 * total number of nodes to the number of leaves using the equation 'N = 2L - 1', where 'N' is the total number of nodes
 * and 'L' is the number of leaves. Since the root of each subtree is effectively stored in the lookup table, this
 * equation reduces to 'N = 2L - 2' for all but (potentially) the "last" subtree. Expanding this equation out to account
 * for 'M' subtrees, we get the equation 'N = M * (2L - 2)'. This implies that the total number of nodes _decreases_ as
 * the number of subtrees increases. I.e. the maximum amount of memory usage occurs when M is smallest. The sole
 * exception is the "right-most" path, which can have nodes that only have one child. Therefore, in order to determine
 * the maximum number of nodes in all subtrees, and therefore the total amount of memory we need to allocate for the
 * lookup table/binary tree array, we can consider the fewest number of subtrees that can hold 'K - 1' nodes (where 'K'
 * is the size of the dictionary) and a final subtree with a single node at max height. This final tree maximizes the
 * number of "dead" nodes that we have to allocate thanks to our indexing scheme. Note that it's possible for other
 * configuration(s) to require the same amount of memory[1], however it's not possible for them to require more memory.
 * By considering such trees, we can calculate the maximum amount of memory needed for each array:
 *
 *      1.  Code Length Tree: These code lengths are encoded using 3 bits (0-7) and can therefore all fit in the lookup
 *          table. Therefore, the max array size needed is 128.
 *      2.  Distance Tree: These code lengths are encoded using the code length tree and therefore have a maximum length
 *          of 15 bits. We use 7 bits for the indexing into the lookup table, leaving 8 bits for the binary tree portion
 *          of the array. The distance alphabet has a size of 32, so one tree structure that give us max memory usage
 *          is: one subtree contains 31 nodes and another contains a single node at max height. Solving for the total
 *          number of nodes gives '(31 * 2 - 2) + (2 * 8) = 76'. This gives a max array size of 128 + 76 = 204.
 *      3.  Literal/Length Tree: These code lengths are also encoded using the code length tree and therefore have a
 *          maximum of 15 bits. Unlike the above two trees, the lookup table uses 9-bit indices for the lookup table,
 *          leaving 6 bits for the binary tree portion of the array. The literal/length alphabet has a size of 288.
 *          Dividing this size by 64 - the maximum number of leaves in a single subtree - gives 4, remainder 32. One
 *          tree structure that give us max memory usage is: one subtree with 31 leaves, 4 subtrees with 64 leaves, and
 *          a final subtree with a single leaf at max height. Solving for the total number of nodes gives
 *          '(31 * 2 - 2) + 4 * (64 * 2 - 2) + (2 * 6) = 576'. This gives a max array size of 512 + 576 = 1088.
 *
 * [1]  This can occur if the last subtree can be arranged such that the left half is "optimally packed" and the right
 *      half consists of the single, final node at max height. This trades off one "dead" node from the last tree for an
 *      additional node gained by being able to increase a single node's height by one. The net change from the maximums
 *      calculated above is zero.
