 * symbols don't occur in the compressed portion of the data).

     * All data is stored in a single table, however the meaning of each entry, as well as how to access each entry,
     * depends on where in the table each entry resides. Conceptually, the table looks like the following:
     *
     *          Lookup Table        Binary Tree
     *      +-------------------+-------------------+
     *      |   |   |  ...  |   |   |  ...  |   |   |
     *      +-------------------+-------------------+
     *      |<-- 2^N elements ->|
     *
     * N - the size of the lookup table - is heuristically chosen based on the size of the alphabet that the Huffman
     * tree is meant to encode. Huffman codes that are N bits or less have their data stored directly in the lookup
     * table. Codes that are less than N bits are stored at 2^(N-len) locations in the table: one for each index where
     * the lower bits match the (reversed) code. For example, if some symbol has the Huffman code '110', then all
     * indices that begin with '011' will reference that symbol: 0000011, 0001011, 0010011, 0011011, ..., 1111011. For
     * codes that are longer than N bits, the table entry indexed by the first N bits (reversed) will reference an
     * offset in the binary tree portion of the array divided by two. E.g. a value of '5' would yield the index created
     * by adding the length of the lookup table with 10. The next bit indicates which index this offset refers to: index
     * 10 for '0' and index 11 for '1' in the above example. This continues until a terminal node is encountered.

         * bit-size means that 'symbol' is an offset in the binary tree array. In the binary tree table, a value equal
         * to the current bit count required to get that far means that the node is a leaf node and 'symbol' is the
